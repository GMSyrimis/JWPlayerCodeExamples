# JW Player Code Examples

A repository of a few interesting test pages, Android Applications and Python scripts I've put together in the past.

They are meant to serve as a code example for anyone interested in using the JW Player stack. 

These examples:

* Are not complete solutions
* Are not meant for production environments
* Do not imply supported use cases
* Are not affiliated to JW Player in any way other than the fact I am using their libraries to showcase certain features and functionalities
